In pure C, and i also change up the text editor to EMACS.
This is actually quite the challenge, i haven't programmed
in C for quite some time, and i also didn't really programmed
without any LSP and so on (this is why i wanna do the challenge)

Build command:
`zig cc day-n/day-n.c -I.. -o day-n.exe`

Oh yeah and i'm on windows.
